### SingleTon
- A singleton is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance
    - UseFul:- when exactly `1 object` is needed to perform actions across the system.
- Key Characteristics of a Singleton:
    1. Single Instance: Only one instance of the class is created.
    2. Global Access: The single instance is accessible globally.
    3. Controlled Access: The class controls the instantiation process, typically through a `static method.`


Ideal Example that many people uses
1. static amGHOST_System Instance inside a Function:- To EnSure DESTRUCTOR CALL upon Crash
2. public DELETED Copy-Constructor & Assignment Operator
3. Protected CONSTRUCTOR & DESTRUCTOR
```cpp
class amGHOST_System {
public:
    // Public method to access the single instance
    static amGHOST_System& getInstance() {
        static amGHOST_System instance;
        // Makes sure THE DESTRUCTOR IS ALWAYS CALLED UPON PROGRAM EXIT / CRASH
        return instance;
    }

    // Delete copy constructor and assignment operator to prevent copying
    // Brendan's Solution
    amGHOST_System(const amGHOST_System&) = delete;
    amGHOST_System& operator=(const amGHOST_System&) = delete;

protected:
    // Protected constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    amGHOST_System() {
        // Initialization code here
    }

    // Destructor
    ~amGHOST_System() {
        // Cleanup code here
    }
};
```
