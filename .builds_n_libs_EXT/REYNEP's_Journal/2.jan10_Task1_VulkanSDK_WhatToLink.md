REYNEP:- `vulkan-1.dll` vs `vulkan-1.lib` on windows. Which should I link?

CoPilot:- 
    On Windows, you should link against `vulkan-1.lib` during the build process. The .lib file is the import library that the linker uses to resolve external references to the Vulkan functions. The `vulkan-1.dll` is the dynamic link library that contains the actual implementation of the Vulkan functions and is required at runtime.

    Here's how you can link vulkan-1.lib in your CMakeLists.txt:
        // ...existing code...
        find_package(Vulkan REQUIRED)
        target_link_libraries(your_target Vulkan::Vulkan)
        // ...existing code...

    Make sure you have the Vulkan SDK installed and properly set up on your system.

REYNEP:- 
    i see a `wulkan-1.dll` inside my `C:/Windows/System32`
    did windows or nvidia driver automatically install this or like `LUNARG VulkanSDK` placed the dll inside System32

CoPilot:-
    The vulkan-1.dll file in `C:/Windows/System32` is typically installed by the graphics driver (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel) as part of their Vulkan support. It is not placed there by the LunarG Vulkan SDK. The Vulkan SDK provides development tools and libraries, but it does not install the runtime DLLs into the `System32` directory.

    To use Vulkan in your project, you should link against the `vulkan-1.lib` provided by the Vulkan SDK. Here is how you can modify your CMakeLists.txt to link against Vulkan:

        // ...existing code...
        find_package(Vulkan REQUIRED)
        target_link_libraries(your_target Vulkan::Vulkan)
        // ...existing code...

    Make sure you have the Vulkan SDK installed and properly set up on your system. The SDK will provide the necessary `vulkan-1.lib` file for linking.
