```py
1. How Blender Does it --> 4/10
    -1:- Libs & Include has to be Manually Updated.
    +5:- Use Github to keep track of LIBS & Include Versions

2. CMAKE FETCH --> 7/10
    -1:- Download Progress is shown by taking up so many lines, like hundreds.
    -2:- Can't Fetch SPECIFIC Folder/SubDirectory from a repo from GITHUB

3. Python Script to Download --> 5/10
4. GIT SubModule --> 4/10
5. Maintaining a .zip in GDrive --> 2/10
6. Just supplying all the external library binaries along with the project souurce --> 1/10
```



### My Approach:- `CMAKE_FETCH` + Blender's Approach
    1. CMAKE_FETCH most stuffs ----> like fmt
    2. .libs_MOD = Libraries CUT/Stripped/Modified by REYNEP ----> like vulkan
        Supplying these like Blender supplies their External Libraries

```py
.repo
    |- .build_n_libs_EXT
        |- .build_CMAKE = CMake Configuration & Building. VSCODE Settings:- "cmake.buildDirectory"

        |- .libs_CMAKE_FETCH = external libraries that need to be built PER_OS/PLATFORM
            |- fmt:- https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt

        |- .libs_GIT = alternative to CMAKE_FETCH. i.e. Manually Building üòµ‚Äçüí´
        |- .libs_MOD = alternative to CMAKE_FETCH.
            |- include = GIT_REPO
            |- linux   = GIT_REPO
            |- osX     = GIT_REPO
            |- win32   = GIT_REPO
                These 4 above are Separate GIT_REPOs that I plan on to maintain
            |- vulkan:-
            |- Stuff that "I Don't have to build" like vulkan. LunarG Builds & serves those
            |- CUSTOM_MODIFIED_Libraries would be here.
            |- Libraries with HUGE_DOWNLOAD size, I cut them & keep them here.

        |- .sandbox_libs_EXT = My SandBox for playing around with libraries
```
